									<h2>AIdeathon 2025 - Chaos Edition</h2>
									<p>AIdeathon 2025 - Chaos Edition is a dynamic workshop designed to introduce participants to the LUMA Design Thinking framework, a structured yet flexible approach to creative problem-solving. Through guided activities and interactive discussions, participants will learn how to approach challenges with empathy, generate innovative ideas, and develop solutions that are both practical and impactful. The session provides an accessible introduction to the key stages of the LUMA framework—looking, understanding, and making—while emphasizing collaboration and experimentation as core elements of the design thinking process.</p>
									<p>Participants will then put their learning into action by applying the LUMA methods to real-world scenarios. Working in teams, they’ll analyze user needs, brainstorm creative solutions, and prototype their ideas in an engaging, hands-on environment. By the end of the workshop, attendees will have not only experienced the power of design thinking firsthand but also gained practical tools and mindsets they can use to solve complex problems in their studies, workplaces, and communities.</p>
